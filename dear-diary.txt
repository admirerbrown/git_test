entry 1.
dear diary, today i think am atleast okay with cloning a repository from a remote version to a local repository.
but i have run into a difficult situation that is proving unsolvable.
i tried using the second method of creating a project on git hub.and unfortunately the repository and its sub-directory shows but the 
files inside the sub-directory doesnt show in my test editor.i have tried solving this challenge first without googling to see what command i have ommitted.
i think i will continue to try solving this challenge by restarting the whole process of the initialization method.
well i will let u know what happpens next in this new challenge of mine. well i find git interesting and so i will solve this challenge before moving on  unto my next lesson of HTLM basics.
see u next time diary.
