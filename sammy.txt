practising day three    i am revisiting this lesson to see if everything i have learnt is family to my fingertips and also to see if i can steadily solidify everything that i have learnt so far under practising 1o1.
i have run into an unexpected error while trying to commit the modified file this day. i seek to resolve it and make progress and never repeating the same mistake.
