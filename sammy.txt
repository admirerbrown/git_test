practising day three. i am revisiting this lesson to see if everything i have learnt is finally to my fingertips and also to see if i can steadily solidify everything that i have learnt so far under practising 1o1.
i have run into an unexpected error while trying to commit the modified file this day. i seek to resolve it and make progress and never repeat the same mistake.
i have finally been able to resolve my issue of unable to commit my staged file by figuring out how to unstage the modified file and reseting Head to remove the tracked file.the plus for me is that i was able to get the new and modified file that had already been staged.the overall plus for me today is that i made a progress by getting myself out of trouble after i got into trouble. i hope to solve my issues locally and not resolve to online forums for help when i get into trouble practicing my basic git and github workflow.
